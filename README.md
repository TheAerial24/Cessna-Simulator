Hello!!! 
This is a project i have been working on for the past couple months, and im finally happy with the physics and looks.
The game starts with a plane on a runway, where you need to takeoff. in the future I may add missions or some sort of
actual "Gameplay" but as of right now it is going to stay a simulator. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated! 
Have fun!
